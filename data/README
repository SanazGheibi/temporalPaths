The cpp files in this folder are used to preprocess the raw datasets and turn them into the files in ../inputGraphs which are directly fed into the tempoarl path algorithms. 

-edgeCnt.sh is used with the webScope flow networks to unzip all the folders and count the number of edges in them.  

- airportPrep.cpp is used to preprocess the airline .csv files corresponding to 1 month of data from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp. It is compiled using 
g++ airportPrep.cpp -o airportPrep
and ran using 
./airportPrep <path to the output file> 

** Currently, the path to the input file is hardcoded in the file. I should fix that ** 

- stateTimeZones.csv is used to build the time zone hash table in airportPrep.cpp
- timeZone.ods is the initial file used to build stateTimeZones.csv
