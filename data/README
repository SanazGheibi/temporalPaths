The cpp files in this folder are used to preprocess the raw datasets and turn them into the files in ../inputGraphs which are directly fed into the tempoarl path algorithms. 

-edgeCnt.sh is used with the webScope flow networks to unzip all the folders and count the number of edges in them.  

- airportPrep.cpp is used to preprocess the airline .csv files corresponding to 1 month of data from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp. It is compiled using 
g++ -std=c++11 airportPrep.cpp -o airportPrep
and ran using 
./airportPrep <path to the input file> <path to the output file>

- konectPrep.cpp performs the required preprocessing on the datasets taken from the konect website () to make them compatible with the temPath input specifications. 
g++ -std=c++11 konectPrep.cpp -o konectPrep
/konectPrep [-t if tab-delimited OR -s if space-delimited] <path to the input file> <path to the output file>, -u [optinal - if undirected] 
** Actually in case the input graph is undirected, only having 4 input arguments suffices and there is no need to explicitly input -u. 

- stateTimeZones.csv is used to build the time zone hash table in airportPrep.cpp
- timeZone.ods is the initial file used to build stateTimeZones.csv
