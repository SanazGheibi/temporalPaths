The "data" folder contains the raw data and the pre-processing methods. 
The "inputGraphs" folder contains the data ready to be input to the shortest path methods. 
"init1.txt" and "test1.txt" are toy inputs from Figure 2 of Wu et. al. paper. 


initProd.cpp is used to produce the initial source node IDs from which the single source shortest paths are computed. To compile, use:
g++ initProd.cpp -o initProd

Useage is as follows:
./initProd <init_points> <|V|> <init_file>

I have decided to name the init files in the following manner: 
init_<num sources>_<|V|>_ID 

Where ID is a number starting from 1 defining how many of those files we have.
